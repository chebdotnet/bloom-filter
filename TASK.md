# CyberCube Test Task
Provide us source code, unit tests, a maven module (don't have to use spring boot) and documentation explaining your small project which implements a bloom filter as described [here](http://codekata.com/kata/kata05-bloom-filters/) (don't use the existing library).

The test input should be the list of words referenced in this exercise description.

Source code should be ready for production as an external library.

Of course, the source code and the test should be written by yourself.
